# Limited Press Records

The website is for a business called Limited Press Records. 

Limited Press operates both as a physical record store selling vinyl records specialising in music from the independent and alternative music scene as well as a label releasing limited vinyl releases under their own name.
 
The website does not currently offer an online ordering system and for now is meant to encourage people to visit the store so the site acts as an information point for people wishing to know more about their releases and in-store events via social media feeds.

## Features 

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so. You will need to explain what value each of the features provides for the user, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

### Existing Features

- __Navigation Bar__

  - A consistently designed navigation bar that appears on all of the site pages and allows visitors to navigate easily from one section of the site to another.

- __Footer__

  - A common footer will also appear on the bottom of every page with links to social media as well as company contact details.

- __Hero Image__

  - A unique hero image on every page for graphic impact as well as means of highlighting what page the visitor is on.

- __Stories__

  - A ‘Stories’ section that highlights a particular artist and their release as a means of giving fans an inside look into the creation of that album and the artist process and thoughts on the release. This page would act as a gateway page listing the various artist interviews that would then link to the individual interview pages.

- __Releases__

  - A ‘Release’ section that would list all the releases by the label that would then link to individual pages listing the information for a specific release.


- __Contact Page__

  - A ‘Contact’ page listing the store address, opening hours as well as a form to submit a message and the option to sign up for a newsletter.


### Future features

- In the future an online shopping option would be implemented. The online shop would act as means of strictly selling the exclusive Limited Press releases to a wider audience due to their collector appeal. By limiting the store to its own releases it would allow the business to have a better sense of its stock situation and would not need to worry about selling other label releases that are easily available elsewhere and could be effected by external factors.

- I would also like to add a social media feed such as Instragram or Twitter that would allow the business to quickly update customers about events or releases in the shop. I think that by including this feature it would allow the owners to quickly update customers without the need to go and edit the site for each news item. 




## Testing 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.


### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Ftberrigan2101.github.io%2Fproject-one%2Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Ftberrigan2101.github.io%2Fproject-one%2F&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub) 

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

## Other General Project Advice

Below you will find a couple of extra tips that may be helpful when completing your project. Remember that each of these projects will become part of your final portfolio so it’s important to allow enough time to showcase your best work! 

- One of the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history is with the commit message. When getting started with your project, read through [this article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) by Chris Beams on How to Write  a Git Commit Message 
  - Make sure to keep the messages in the imperative mood 

- When naming the files in your project directory, make sure to consider meaningful naming of files, point to specific names and sections of content.
  - For example, instead of naming an image used ‘image1.png’ consider naming it ‘landing_page_img.png’. This will ensure that there are clear file paths kept. 

- Do some extra research on good and bad coding practices, there are a handful of useful articles to read, consider reviewing the following list when getting started:
  - [Writing Your Best Code](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/writing-your-best-code/)
  - [HTML & CSS Coding Best Practices](https://medium.com/@inceptiondj.info/html-css-coding-best-practice-fadb9870a00f)
  - [Google HTML/CSS Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html#General)

Getting started with your Portfolio Projects can be daunting, planning your project can make it a lot easier to tackle, take small steps to reach the final outcome and enjoy the process!
