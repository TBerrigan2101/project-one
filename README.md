# Limited Press Records

The website is for a business called Limited Press Records. 

Limited Press operates both as a physical record store selling vinyl records specialising in music from the independent and alternative music scene as well as a label releasing limited vinyl releases under their own name.
 
The website does not currently offer an online ordering system and for now is meant to encourage people to visit the store so the site acts as an information point for people wishing to know more about their releases and in-store events via social media feeds.

## 1. Features 



- __Navigation Bar__

  - A consistently designed navigation bar that appears on all of the site pages and allows visitors to navigate easily from one section of the site to another.

- __Footer__

  - A common footer will also appear on the bottom of every page with links to social media as well as company contact details.

- __Hero Image__

  - A unique hero image on every page for graphic impact as well as means of highlighting what page the visitor is on.

- __Stories__

  - A ‘Stories’ section that highlights a particular artist and their release as a means of giving fans an inside look into the creation of that album and the artist process and thoughts on the release. This page would act as a gateway page listing the various artist interviews that would then link to the individual interview pages.

- __Releases__

  - A ‘Release’ section that would list all the releases by the label that would then link to individual pages listing the information for a specific release.


- __Contact Page__

  - A ‘Contact’ page listing the store address, opening hours as well as a form to submit a message and the option to sign up for a newsletter.


## 2. Future features

- In the future an online shopping option would be implemented. The online shop would act as means of strictly selling the exclusive Limited Press releases to a wider audience due to their collector appeal. By limiting the store to its own releases it would allow the business to have a better sense of its stock situation and would not need to worry about selling other label releases that are easily available elsewhere and could be effected by external factors.

- I would also like to add a social media feed such as Instragram or Twitter that would allow the business to quickly update customers about events or releases in the shop. I think that by including this feature it would allow the owners to quickly update customers without the need to go and edit the site for each news item. 

## 3. Typography and Colour Scheme

- I designed the logo for this website so the colour scheme and typography choices are influenced by the logo to create a consistent brand/style throughout.  Oswald is used for headings and emphasis text, I chose it for its bold and clean style to echo that of the logo and Open Sans for some contrast as well as good legibility.

- The colour scheme is minimalist with three colours used at maximum.  I chose these colours to allow for strong contrast and they are also influenced by colour schemes I have seen on similar independent record label sites ([Deep Elm](www.deepelm.com), [No Sleep](www.nosleeprecords.com),
[Artic Rodeo](www.arcticrodeorecordings.com) as three examples) and I wanted to create something similar as that would be the market the site it aimed at.

## 8. Testing 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.


### 8.1 Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Ftberrigan2101.github.io%2Fproject-one%2Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Ftberrigan2101.github.io%2Fproject-one%2F&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)


### 8.1 Supported Screens and Browsers

- I tested the site using Chrome, Safari and Firefox and all browsers tested fine.


### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

## 9. Deployment


- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
